## How to use this template

- ⚠️ **Don't fork this repository.** Use the "Use this template" green GitHub
  button.
- Put your bindings in `src/ReactNativeSomething` & rename accordingly or use
  `bsconfig.json` `"namespace"` field (more on this below),
- Update all occurences of

  - `@reason-react-native/__template__`
  - `https://github.com/reason-react-native/__template__`
  - `__template__`
  - `@react-native-community/something`
  - `https://github.com/react-native-community/something`
  - `ReactNativeSomething`. If you have more than a file exposed, you should
    consider using BuckleScript custom namespace by adjusting `bsconfig.json`
    and adding a `"namespace": "react-native-something"` (note that it will be
    converted to `ReactNativeSomething`)

- Add your `@react-native-community/something` (adjusted) in `peerDependencies`
  & `devDependencies` section
- Adjust the changelog (and/or clean it)
- Remove this part ⬆ & keep everything below ⬇
